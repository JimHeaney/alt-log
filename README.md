# Alt-Log

## Overview
The Alt-Log is a new low-cost, powerful altimeter I developed for high-powered rockets. There are two variants I am developing. They both measure altitude up to 30,000 feet ASL and log it to an SD card. The first is designed to be as simple and straightforward as possible, while the second is the fancier one. It includes onboard memory to log the flight data, which can then be dumped to the SD card after landing. this will allow for a faster polling rate, and allows me to log other information, like temperature and battery voltage.

The complex board also has a set of LEDs that can be used to tell the onboard status, and the onboard memory allows me to have a configurable settings file on the SD card, to set dozens of different parameters for the best data collection.

## Current Release
Version 1.3

## Current State
